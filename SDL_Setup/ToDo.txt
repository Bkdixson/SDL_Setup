* Friction in physics (fix the bug)
	* static friction also

* Limit velocity

* Tweak the WALKING_FORCE, Player mass, and friction to get a nice feel

* Change Entities to include more than one texture. i.e. facing left and facing right

* Tidy up some code
	* Use a vector to hold the terrain clips (in main)
	* Make a Gamestate ... stop declaring important things in main
