* Friction in physics (fix the bug)
	* static friction also

* Creat maxX and maxY for entity positions
	* Will need to keep the screen size dynamic
		* Make sure the screen size is already fully dynamic (based on the input from the map file)

* Limit velocity

* Tweak the WALKING_FORCE, Player mass, and friction to get a nice feel

* Change Entities to include more than one texture. i.e. facing left and facing right

* Tidy up some code
	* Use a vector to hold the terrain clips (in main)
	* Make a Gamestate ... stop declaring important things in main
	* Remove the mess (the commented-out code) from Physics.cpp. Choose either component-based or vector-based math for the static friction calculation

* True-Type fonts!
	* Let's get a HUD going (at the top or bottom?)
	* Velocity / position / force display
	... health? Dun dun dun.

* Limit frame rate
	* Display frame rate i the HUD
