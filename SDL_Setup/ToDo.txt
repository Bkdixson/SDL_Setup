* True-Type fonts!
	* Let's get a HUD going (at the top or bottom?)
	* Velocity / position / force display
	* ... health? Dun dun dun.

* Add Entity objects (like a tree?)
	* Will need to overlay the terrain
	* Will need to A) display over the player, or B) display under the player
	* Might need separate parts, like the leaves of a tree could display over the player, but a player couldn't walk through the trunk

* Create maxX and maxY for entity positions
	* Will need to keep the screen size dynamic
		* Make sure the screen size is already fully dynamic (based on the input from the map file)

* Walking animation? This could get complicated.

* Tidy up some code
	* Use a vector to hold the terrain clips (in main)
	* Make a Gamestate ... stop declaring important things in main
	* Remove the mess (the commented-out code) from Physics.cpp. Choose either component-based or vector-based math for the static friction calculation
