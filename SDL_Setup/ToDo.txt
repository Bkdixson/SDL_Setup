* Limit frame rate
	* Display frame rate in the HUD
	
* True-Type fonts!
	* Let's get a HUD going (at the top or bottom?)
	* Velocity / position / force display
	* ... health? Dun dun dun.
	
* Limit velocity

* Tweak the WALKING_FORCE, Player mass, and friction to get a nice feel

* Create maxX and maxY for entity positions
	* Will need to keep the screen size dynamic
		* Make sure the screen size is already fully dynamic (based on the input from the map file)

* Walking animation? This could get complicated.

* Tidy up some code
	* Use a vector to hold the terrain clips (in main)
	* Make a Gamestate ... stop declaring important things in main
	* Remove the mess (the commented-out code) from Physics.cpp. Choose either component-based or vector-based math for the static friction calculation
